# Pon guideines for git branching

## Main branch

The main branch contains tested prodcution ready code, releases are tagged on main.

## Sprints

Each sprint has its own branch

## Features

Eeach feature (and bugfix) has its own branch.

## Branching

Branching is done from the main branch to the sprint branches, after coding and testing sprint branch
is merged to main.

## Distinguish between "small" and "large" projects

If you are the only developer it is oke to setup one sprint branch to work on sequentially, there is no need to
setup separate feature branches
