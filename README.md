# Pon guideines for git branching

A visual storyline is shown [here](https://guidelines-git-branching.pages.dev/).

## Branching, merging and tagging

### Main branch

The main branch contains tested prodcution ready code, releases are tagged on main.

### Sprints

Each sprint has its own branch

### Features

Eeach feature (and bugfix) has its own branch.

### Branching

Branching is done from the main branch to the sprint branches, after coding and testing sprint branch
is merged to main.

### Distinguish between "small" and "large" projects

If you are the only developer it is oke to setup one sprint branch to work on sequentially, there is no need to
setup separate feature branches

## General

### Branches

***Basic Rules***

**1. Lowercase and hyphen-separated:** Keep branch names in lowercase and separate words with hyphens. For example, use `feature/booking-tool` or `bugfix/cookie-banner-refresh`.

**2. Alphanumeric characters:** Use only alphanumeric characters (letters a-z, numbers 0â€“9) and hyphens. Avoid using punctuation, spaces, underscores, or any other non-alphanumeric characters.

**3. No consecutive hyphens:** Do not use consecutive hyphens, `feature--booking-tool` can be confusing and hard to read.

**4. No Trailing Hyphens:** Ensure that your branch name does not end with a hyphen. For example, `feature-booking-tool-` is not considered a good practice.

**5. Descriptive:** Make sure the branch name is both descriptive and concise, ideally reflecting the work carried out on the branch

**6. Ticket Numbers:** When possible, include the ticket number from a project management tool like Jira or issue tracking system in the branch name.

***Branch Prefixes***

**1. Feature Branches:** Are used for developing new features. Use the prefix `feature/`. For example, `feature/booking-tool`.

**2. Bugfix Branches:** Are used to fix bugs in the code. Use the prefix `bugfix/`. For example, `bugfix/double-cookiebanner-refresh`.

**3. Hotfix Branches:** Are made directly from the main branch to fix critical bugs in the production environment. Use the prefix `hotfix/`. For example, `hotfix/okta-issue`.

**4. Documentation Branches:** Are used for writing, updating, or correcting documentation. Use the prefix `docs/`. For example, `docs/okta-setup`.

**5. Chore Branches:** Are used for maintenance tasks, build processes, or other non-user-facing changes. Use the prefix `chore/`. For example, `chore/update-okta-dependencies`.

### Squashing or merging

Merging is preferred (merging "unless" policy)

### Forced commits

These guidelines should not impede the handling of emergencies. Forced commits are allowed by exception only
and branch(es) must be fixed at the firs available opportunity.
